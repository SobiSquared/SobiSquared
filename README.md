I am SobiSquared
I'm a bug bounty resercher with an aspiring focus on automation, asset and content discovery.
In almost every way I am a novice. I want to learn from others in this community
and try to provide my own assistance where i can.

All of my tools will be in Python at this time.
If you need to contact me I can be reached at sobi2squared@gmail.com
